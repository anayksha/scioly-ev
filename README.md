# hehe sci oly ev for lambert

as of rn its literally just copy paste from unphayzed except all the stuff about setting target time and target distance with those buttons and rotary encoders is all deleted

Also i fixed *what i thought* were errors in his code, but havent tested it recently so idk

I havent even looked at the movement logic btw

but hopefully the unphayzed code works as a backup; I plan to create new code from scratch that uses a cascading PID system with position and velocity control bc why not atp

i've kept a copy of unphayzed's edited code in the branch `releases/unphayzed-modif` which is where development of that code will happen

later i plan to create a separate branch with custom code and merge it with main

hopefully I will implement a system like unphayzed's where u can set target distance and target time in both of the codes *eventually*
